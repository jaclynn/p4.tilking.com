See*LUV*Get is a site designed to offer services similar to local "yard sale" sites on Facebook. On Facebook, I belong to a group called "West Grove Yard Sale" for local people to sell unwanted things. Posts follow the Facebook format and are listed sequentially unless "bumped" by comments or likes. There are many problems with this model. Like Craiglist it's missing the convenience of online transaction, the posts are hard to see, there are fights over who expressed interest first, someone has to actively moderate, expired posts have to manually groomed, it's difficult to search...

My project does not solve all of these problems but provides the foundation to do so. For example, user interest in an item is time-stamped, posts are listed like items on a wall ("bricks") making them easier to see, items are maintained in a database that can be expanded with categories, items that have not been updated in a while can be automatically removed. 

Since I am one of the many frustrated West Grove Yard sale users, I plan to expand on this site after class is over. I have reserved both cluvget.com and seeluvget.com. I plan to enhance (probably rewrite) my P4, add Facebook login, get a faster loading pinterest-like plugin, add categories to the bricks, implement more ajax to accommodate multi-user, Paypal, and a messaging feature. Ambitious, but I think it could work.

Thank you for an immensely interesting, well-taught and well-organized class. I feel it was worth every penny.
