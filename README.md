See*LUV*Get is a site designed to offer services similar to local "yard sale" sites on Facebook. On Facebook, I belong to a group called "West Grove Yard Sale" for local people to sell unwanted things. Posts follow the Facebook format and are listed sequentially unless "bumped" by comments or likes. There are many problems with this model. The posts are hard to see, there are fights over who expressed interest first, someone has to actively moderate, it's difficult to search...

My project does not solve all of these problems but provides the framework to do so. For example, user interest in an item is time-stamped, posts are listed like items on a wall ("bricks") making them easier to see, items are maintained in a database that can be expanded with categories, items that have not been updated in a while can be automatically removed. 

I plan to expand on this site after class is over. I have reserved both cluvget.com and seeluvget.com. I am one of the many frustrated users on West Grove Yard Sale (Facebook). I plan to perfect (probably rewrite) my P4, add Facebook login, get a faster loading pinterest-like plugin, add categories to the bricks, implement more ajax to accommodate multi-user, and a messaging feature. Ambitious, but I think it could work.
